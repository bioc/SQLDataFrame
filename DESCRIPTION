Package: SQLDataFrame
Title: Representation of SQL tables in DataFrame metaphor
Version: 1.17.1
Description:
    Implements bindings for SQL tables that are compatible with
    Bioconductor S4 data structures, namely the DataFrame and
    DelayedArray. This allows SQL-derived data to be easily used
    inside other Bioconductor objects (e.g., SummarizedExperiments)
    while keeping everything on disk.
